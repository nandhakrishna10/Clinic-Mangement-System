# Clinic-Mangement-System

Our clinic management system is a comprehensive and efficient solution built using Python and tkinter GUI. Patients can effortlessly book appointments with doctors, while doctors can access and update patients' medical histories and recent observations. To streamline the patient flow, a dynamic queue system is implemented, distinguishing between low and high priority cases, efficiently managed by the receptionist. The system's user-friendly interface and seamless integration with CSV files ensure secure data storage and retrieval. This project optimizes clinic operations, enhancing patient experience and healthcare delivery, ultimately contributing to a well-organized and patient-centric medical environment.
